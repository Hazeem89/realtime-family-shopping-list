## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create `client/.env`:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Running the App

## How It Works

1. Sign up and a profile is created automatically
2. Create a family — you get an invite code to share
3. Other family members sign up and join using the invite code
4. All members share the same shopping list, synced in real time via Supabase Realtime
